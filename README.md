# Introduction
The aim of this repository is to display some code I develop for fun.

There are three subprojects:

* temperatures-spark: Spark example that explain how to use spark with data loaded from a CSV of temperatures. This CVS is saved on a Cassandra DB. It includes detailed instructions to have a simple example up and running on a local spark instance.
* temperatures-akka: controller application that uses AKKA HTTP and AKKA ACTORS. It calls the temperatures-spark project
* algorithms: Algorithms code developed from codility exercices or from www.hackerrank.com.
