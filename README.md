# Introduction
The aim of this repository is to display some code I develop for fun.

There are two subprojects:

* Spark example that explain how to use spark with data loaded from a CSV of temperatures. This CVS is saved on a Cassandra DB. It includes detailed instructions to have a simple example up and running on a local spark instance.
* Algorithms code developed from codility exercices or from www.hackerrank.com.
